# OLDBot (Online Lessons Discord Bot)

### Version: 0.0.1

This program is designed to facilitate online lessons. With this you don't need to get up early. Just config and watch the program resolve itself. 
It automatically enters to the lesson at the specified start time, mutes itself and enters a text that we set.

## Features

- Automatically join voice channels
- Auto self mute
- Send custome message to text channel.

## Usage

A **config.json** file is needed at the same directory as the program (OLDBot) in. We can config the bot in the **config.json** file.
First step, need to replace `"SERVER's id"` and `"VOICE_CHANNEL'S ID"`

## Changelog

0.0.1 (11/19/2021):

- First Release

## Comment

An executable (exe) in the **executable** folder, but if you don't trust me then you can compile yourself with [CEngine](https://github.com/Mesteri05/CEngine) or your own py-to-exe converter.
